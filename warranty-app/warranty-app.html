                    <h1>Power Safety Warning</h1>
                    <p>WARNING: Install the Adaptor near a Power outlet. The AC power cord is the Adaptor main AC disconnecting device and must be easily accessible at all times. For your safety, the power cord provided with your Adaptor has a grounded plug. Always use the power cord with a properly grounded wall outlet, to avoid the risk of electrical shock. WARNING: Your Adaptor is provided with a voltage select switch for use in a 115 or 230V power system. The voltage select switch has been pre-set to the correct voltage setting for use in the particular country/region where it was initially sold. Changing the voltage select switch to the incorrect position can damage your Adaptor and void any implied warranty.</p>
                    <p>WARNING: Do not operate the Adaptor with the cover removed.</p>
